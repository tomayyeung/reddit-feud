/**
 * Circuit-breaking triggers a {scope=REMOTE, async=false, retry=true} event.
 * This triggers a {scope=ALL, async=true, retry=false} event. In
 * practice, that has some slight implications for how it flows through the
 * event loop. If we wanted to, we could change this out, if we fully understand
 * the semantics. This aligns more with useAsync than circuit-breaking today,
